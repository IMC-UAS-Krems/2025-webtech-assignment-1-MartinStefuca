                    I was born on the <i>6th of November 2005</i> in the capital of Slovakia, <b>Bratislava</b>. I lived
                    in the city for the first few years of my life, until my parents separated. Afterwards, I was
                    switching between the two.

                    In my elementary school I have met people that I can call best friends even today. Za kasárňou (the
                    elementary school) has not only given me a solid foundation in my education but also created some of
                    my most memorable memories. Highschool was also great, I have also created lots of friends there and
                    learned to speak English fluently, already in the first year, which helped me massively with what
                    was about to come.

                    The second year of highschool I didn't visit the same school. My step-father got a job offer in
                    Egypt where we have relocated for 2 years. It was a splendid experience that fostered my english
                    fluency as well as confidance in speaking. People there came from different backgrounds and it was
                    highly interesting to talk to them (especially my friend from North Korea). After the 2 years I have
                    returned to Slovakia and finished my mandatory education there.
